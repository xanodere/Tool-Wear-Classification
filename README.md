# Tool-Wear-Classification

Here you will find two notebooks and two HTML reports. 
This project classifies the wear and tear of industrial tools from images.
The implementation of the neural networks does not use any libraries, indeed the backpropation and the descending gradient algorithm have been implemented by hand. 
The aim of this project was to try to implement low-level deep learning algorithms and to test them.
